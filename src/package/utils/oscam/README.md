Just copy/clone to package directory of openwrt source or openwrt sdk.
Run 'make' to build with package defaults or 'make menuconfig'
to select build options, and then 'make' to build it.
To build desired revision, chage the PKG_REV variable in Makefile.
Sugestions, improvements are welcomed.
Have Fun.
